Why C++ doesn't allow creating const member function?
Why C++ doesn't allow 'this' pointer to access a static member data?

Answer:
-Since 'const' is used to specify that a member function does not modify  the state for an instance
(i.e, it does not modify the instance's member variables), and static member functions do not
operate on instances at all, applying 'const' to a static member function is meaningless.

-The 'this' pointer in C++ is a special pointer available within non-static member fuctions. It
points to the object for which the member function is called. In other words, it provides access
to the instance-specific data member of a class.

Static member funcions do not belong to any particular instance of the class. They are class-level
function, meaning they can be called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class.
Therefore, within a static member function, there is no 'this' pointer because there is no instance
to refer to .
